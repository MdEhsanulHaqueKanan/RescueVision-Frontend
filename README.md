**RescueVision** is a sophisticated, web-based command center designed to accelerate search and rescue (SAR) operations by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence. This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) serves as an **after-action review and intelligence gathering tool**, allowing operators to rapidly analyze hours of aerial drone footage and pinpoint critical events.

The platform fuses two powerful AI capabilities into a single, intuitive interface:
1.  **AI-Powered Video Analysis:** A custom-trained deep learning model automatically scans drone videos to detect and log every instance of a potential survivor.
2.  **A Mission AI Assistant:** A conversational AI, powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, that provides instant, expert-level answers to operator questions based on official FEMA SAR manuals.

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end workflow, from a stunning user interface built with modern web technologies to its seamless integration with a powerful, custom-built AI backend.

## ‚ú® Core Features (Investor & User Perspective)

### 1. Automated Event Detection & Logging

Instead of forcing an operator to manually scrub through hours of footage, RescueVision automates the process, creating a high-value intelligence report.

*   **Upload & Process:** The operator uploads a drone video file. The system enters a professional "ANALYZING FOOTAGE..." state, clearly communicating that its powerful AI backend is at work.
*   **Automated Log Generation:** After processing, the **Detections Log** is instantly populated with a complete, time-stamped list of every high-confidence detection.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Each event is tagged with a clear confidence score (e.g., **"Confidence: 83%"**), allowing the operator to prioritize the most likely sightings.

### 2. Flawless, Pixel-Perfect Event Review

This is the core of the user experience. The platform eliminates the ambiguity of real-time tracking in favor of precision analysis.

*   **Click-to-View:** When an operator clicks on any event in the Detections Log (e.g., "Survivor at 00:28"), the video player instantly jumps to that exact timestamp and **pauses**.
*   **Pixel-Perfect Bounding Box:** A single, static, and **perfectly aligned** bounding box is drawn on the paused frame, definitively highlighting the detected survivor. This provides an unambiguous ground truth for the operator.
*   **Clean Playback:** When the operator presses "Play" to view the context around the event, the bounding box cleanly disappears, allowing for an unobstructed view of the footage.

### 3. Integrated AI Mission Support

Operators can instantly access expert-level knowledge without ever leaving the command center interface.

*   **Conversational Q&A:** An operator can ask complex, natural-language questions like `"What are the signs and treatment for hypothermia?"` or `"What is the procedure for a swiftwater rescue?"`
*   **Grounded, Authoritative Answers:** The **Mission AI Assistant** does not hallucinate. It retrieves and displays relevant passages directly from its knowledge base of official FEMA Search and Rescue manuals, providing reliable, life-saving information.
